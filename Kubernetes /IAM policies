When creating an Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster on the AWS Management Console, 
you typically need to define IAM roles for both the control plane and the worker nodes (data plane). 
Here are the recommended IAM roles for each:

#############Master Node (Control Plane) #################
AmazonEKSClusterPolicy: This managed policy provides the necessary permissions for the Amazon EKS control plane to manage resources on your behalf. 
You can attach this policy directly to the IAM role used for the EKS cluster's control plane.

########## Woker Node (Data Plane) ######################

Amazon EKS Worker Node Policy:
This policy (AmazonEKSClusterNodegroupPolicy) allows worker nodes to join the EKS cluster and perform necessary operations within the cluster.

Amazon EKS CNI Policy:
1)This policy (AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy) grants worker nodes the necessary permissions for the Amazon VPC CNI (Container Network Interface) plugin to function correctly. 
2)It enables communication between pods and allows the CNI plugin to manage network resources.
3)The Amazon EKS CNI plugin is responsible for allocating and managing IP addresses for pods, setting up network routes, and configuring security groups. 
Without the necessary permissions granted by the CNI policy, the worker nodes won't be able to perform these networking operations.
4)The CNI policy allows worker nodes to communicate with the Amazon VPC and 
ensures that pods within the EKS cluster can communicate with each other and with external resources.


Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) Read-Only Policy:
If your worker nodes need to pull container images from Amazon ECR, you should attach the AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly managed policy 
or a custom policy that provides read-only access to the ECR repositories.
